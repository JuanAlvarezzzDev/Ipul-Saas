# IPUL SaaS

The goal of this project is to develop a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform tailored for church accounting needs. This system is specifically designed for the **Pentecostal United Latin American Church (IPUL)** in Panama, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for financial management.

## Project Overview

This SaaS platform will allow each church to operate as a distinct team, enabling team-specific data management. Each team can have multiple users, manage their financial transactions, and categorize them under predefined concepts. The platform is scalable, secure, and designed to meet the unique requirements of the IPUL organization.

## Database Design

The database design ensures optimal performance and data integrity while adhering to the client's specifications. Below is the schema representation of the database:

### Key Features of the Database
1. **Multi-Tenant Structure**: 
   - Each church operates as an isolated "team," allowing individual control over users and transactions.
2. **Detailed Transaction Management**: 
   - Supports categorization by transaction concepts and types (e.g., income or expense).
3. **Role-Based Access**: 
   - Users can have different roles, such as administrators or regular members, for enhanced security and functionality.
4. **Audit Trails**: 
   - Tracks transaction creation and updates, ensuring accountability and traceability.

## Future Goals
This platform aims to:
- Simplify financial reporting for churches.
- Provide an intuitive user interface for managing income and expenses.
- Offer data visualization and analytics for better financial decision-making.
